    <p>A dog's nose print is as unique as a human's fingerprint. Additionally, dogs can understand about 100 words and gestures, and their intelligence is comparable to that of a two-year-old child. </p>
    
    <h2>Canine Characteristics</h2>
    <h3>Breed Diversity and History</h3>
    <p>Domestic dogs are believed to have descended from ancient wolves, undergoing domestication over tens of thousands of years. They are highly adaptable and have been bred into hundreds of distinct breeds, each with unique physical traits and temperaments.</p>
    
    <h3>Incredible Senses</h3>
    <p>Dogs possess an extraordinary sense of smell, making them invaluable in roles such as tracking, detection of substances, and even identifying certain medical conditions. Their loyalty and capacity for training are key reasons for their widespread companionship with humans.</p>

    <h2>Feline Features</h2>
    <h3>Natural Instincts and Agility</h3>
    <p>Cats can run up to 30 mph, and their ears can rotate 180 degrees independently to locate sounds. Unlike dogs, they primarily meow to communicate with humans, and purring can sometimes be a sign of stress, not just happiness. Their whiskers are crucial sensory tools, helping them navigate and perceive their environment in the dark.</p>
    
    <h3>Communication and Behavior</h3>
    <p>Domestic cats communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including purrs, meows, hisses, and growls, each conveying different emotions or intentions. Their body language, such as tail position and ear movements, also provides clear signals about their mood.</p>
    
    <h3>Predatory Habits</h3>
    <p>Cats are natural predators with highly refined hunting instincts, even when well-fed. They are known for their incredible agility, ability to jump to high places, and often prefer to nap in warm, secluded spots. Their independence and self-sufficiency are often highlighted characteristics.</p>
